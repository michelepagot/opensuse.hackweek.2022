### Day 1

This day is mostly dedicated to trace a path

#### TO DO

 * Create a webpage to show the progress

#### DONE




### Backlog and ideas

 * Research and contact the opensuse wezterm package mainteiner
 * Look at where to start from
 - Look at similar test in openQA (firefox in x11)
 - where to develope (on which openQA instance)?
 - where to let the test run?
 - where to version the test code (test/lib/schedule): in os-autoinst-distri-opensuse or on the wezterm repo directly (I like more the second one but I'm not sure if it is feasable)
 * try to start natively to code test in python?
 * look at how to trigger:
 - wezterm github action
 - monitoring osd for wezterm package
 * Create a bare minimal hello world test to deploy a TW and install Wezterm
