Today we rock with Wezterm

# TODO

## Hackweek webpage
* Create a new separate page where to start developing a hackweek presentation (reveal.js maybe)

## openQA
* Ask if it is possible to run the test on some existing openQA instance (maybe the o3 public one)
* Keep exploring [isotovideo](https://kalikiana.gitlab.io/post/2022-03-16-running-standandalone-tests-with-isotovideo/)

## Wezterm
* look at needles
* look at how to generate wezterm.lua
