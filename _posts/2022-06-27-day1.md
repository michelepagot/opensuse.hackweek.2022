This day is mostly dedicated to trace a path

# DONE
In Day1 I manage to create a test skeleton but I miss the target to see Wezterm up and running in a openQA test. The TW base test **boot_to_desktop** keep to fail when running on my personal openQA instance. So too few Wezterm for Day1.
I manage to create this page and setup everything locally on my laptop to locally generate this page but I do not master the Jeklly blog generator yet and I do not like as the page is rendered.

## Create a webpage to show the progress
 * repo created
 * gh-pages branch created
 * theme selected and create a first index.md
 * add hackweek logo
 * render the page locally:
  1. looking at [testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) to be able to build the page locally.
  2. Some issue as bundle installed jekyll is not found by bundle as running `bundle exec jekyll`.
  3. This one helps: [devhints.io](https://devhints.io/jekyll) but then ...
  4. I face [issues/399](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/399),
  5. workaround using `PAGES_REPO_NWO=michelepagot/opensuse.hackweek.2022` but then ...
  6. I face (issues/8523)[https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8523] solved by running `bundle add webrick`

... ok, I have my page served locally and enough Ruby for the moment ...

## Test Hello World
Create a bare minimal hello world test to deploy a TW and install Wezterm

### Test code
* maybe tomcat is a good candidate. Use as template these 3 files:
```
  cp schedule/functional/tomcat.yaml schedule/functional/wezterm.yaml
  cp tests/x11/tomcat.pm tests/x11/wezterm.pm
  cp lib/Tomcat/Utils.pm lib/Wezterm/Utils.pm
```

Hackweek test code is published on [wezterm_hackweek](https://github.com/mpagot/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse/tree/wezterm_hackweek)

### How to run my test?

I have some committed test code and a schedule. How to run them? In particular:
* Where to run? On which openQA instance? Do I need an instance?
* How to configure or trigger? Clone? Start from scratch?

I know about **openqa-clone-custom-git-refspec** but how it works? Which openQA instance to use?

I'd like a job to clone. It should be Tumbleweed based (I'm only aware about wezterm package existing for TW).

Should I keep looking at tomcat test as reference? Where tomcat is running in openQA? On which instance? Generally speaking -giving a test name how to find an execution example?-

#### openQA instance
I already have a openQA personal instance on a private server. Otherwise I should look at [o3](https://openqa.opensuse.org/).
Or maybe I do not need an openQA instance at all [isotovideo](https://kalikiana.gitlab.io/post/2022-03-16-running-standandalone-tests-with-isotovideo/)

#### Should I clone "tomcat"?
* look for string **functional/tomcat** in some of the trigger/bot repo that I'm aware of... no luck.
* look in o3 with its search engine ... no luck.
* ask the oracle: google... [issues/91187](https://progress.opensuse.org/issues/91187) and it has a lot of useful links :-)

#### Should I clone a relevant TW job?
[Group and build](https://openqa.opensuse.org/tests/overview?distri=microos&distri=opensuse&version=Tumbleweed&build=20220625&groupid=1)

First attempt: my first attempt was to clone [GNOME on TW](https://openqa.opensuse.org/tests/2436441)

```
openqa.opensuse.orgopenqa.opensuse.org
openQA: opensuse-Tumbleweed-DVD-x86_64-Build20220625-desktopapps-gnome-x11@64bit test results
openQA is a testing framework mainly for distributions
```

as it seems simple enough: 3 steps, 51 sec ...isn't it? But as result of:

```
% openqa-clone-job --from https://openqa.opensuse.org/tests/2436441 --skip-chained-deps  SCHEDULE=tests/boot/boot_to_desktop
```
