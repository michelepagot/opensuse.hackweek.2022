Today I'd like to think for a future for the achieved results.

# DONE

## OpenQA distribution

This hackweek project is to create some openQA tests for Wezterm. This project is more oriented to provide a test tool to the Wezterm project than validating that one Wezterm version can at least start in all the openSUSE Tumbleweed versions.
I'd like to achieve _"Test all the Wezterm features possibly in more than one linux distro"_

Keeping that in mind, what I'm not sure about is _where to "place" them?_



# TODO

## Hackweek webpage
* Create a new separate page where to start developing a hackweek presentation (reveal.js maybe)

## openQA
* Ask if it is possible to run the test on some existing openQA instance (maybe the o3 public one)
* Keep exploring [isotovideo](https://kalikiana.gitlab.io/post/2022-03-16-running-standandalone-tests-with-isotovideo/)
