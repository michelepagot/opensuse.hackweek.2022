I hope for myself more Wezterm fun...

# DONE

## Hackweek webpage
From the github project page configuration I selected the theme **jeklly-theme-minimal**. The theme official documentation is at [minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal).

# TODO

## Hackweek webpage
* Split the Jeklly page on multiple page, one for each day
* Fix the formatting to have the logo on the left column
* Create a new separate page where to start developing a hackweek presentation (reveal.js maybe)

## openQA
* Ask about the failure on my personal openQA instance
* Ask if it is possible to run the test on some existing openQA instance (maybe the o3 public one)
* Keep exploring [isotovideo](https://kalikiana.gitlab.io/post/2022-03-16-running-standandalone-tests-with-isotovideo/)

## Wezterm
* look at needles
* look at how to generate wezterm.lua
